                        Supervising Organization and any station contacts.

                        If the corresponding role code of a CI_ResponsibleParty is “owner”,

                        Organization. Several instances can exist if the validPeriod is
                        specified and if validPeriods are not overlapping, otherwise only the
                        first occurrence will be used.

                        register or update a station contact without a specific station
                        function. If such a station contact should be labeled as
