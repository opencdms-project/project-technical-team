Tests
+++++

- **Sensor based range check** (detects observations that are outside the specified sensor limits), requires observer and result.
- **Domain test** (determines whether the observed value is outside the realm of scientific possibility, e.g. air temperature > 70 Celsius), requires observed_property and result.
- **Climate based range test** (compares the observed value with the climatological upper and lower extreme values), requires location, elevation, date, time observed_property and result. Sensor characteristics can be taken into account if available.
