### Phase I - OpenCDMS prototyping and development (2021-2024)

| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 0.1.x   | Early development - *no shared database model* <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Other projects can make use of OpenCDMS code using their exist data models <br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;e.g. Climsoft App "Powered by OpenCDMS" (see Climsoft roadmap for more information)|
| 0.2     | OpenCDMS beta release *with WMO Climate Data Model (CDM)*. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; - **2023 release for early testing (month TBD)**|
| 0.3     | OpenCDMS MVP (early adopters) - **mid-2023 to mid-2024 (month TBD)** <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Consistent with ClimSA deliverables ("CDMS options tested") <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Planned implementation of ClimSA 2.4.1 common requirements <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Manual data migration / limited migration tools <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Parallel operation with existing CDMSs adding value|

### Phase II - OpenCDMS implementation (2025+)

| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 1.0     | OpenCDMS public release (**early 2025**) <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Support for standards that are supported by CDM <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Possibly not entire CDMS Specifications (*TBD*) <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Migration paths to CDM <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Subjectively compliant with CDMS Specifications|
| 2.0     | OpenCDMS (Reference Implementation for WMO No. 1131 version 2.0) with initial CDMS API &nbsp;&nbsp; - Objectively compliant with CDMS Specifications via initial compliance testing|
| 3.0     | OpenCDMS using final CDMS API Standard with full compliance testing <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Compliance testing also usable by other projects|
