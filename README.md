| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 0.1.x   | Early development - *no shared database model* <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Other projects can make use of OpenCDMS code using their exist data models, e.g. Climsoft App "Powered by OpenCDMS"|
| 0.2     | OpenCDMS beta release with WMO Climate Data Model (CDM). <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; -  Early testing - 2023 release|
| 0.3     | OpenCDMS MVP (early adopters) - mid-2023 to mid-2024 <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Consistent with ClimSA deliverables ("CDMS options tested") <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Planned implementation of ClimSA 2.4.1 common requirements <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Manual data migration / limited migration tools / parallel operation adds value|

### Phase II - OpenCDMS implementation (2025+)

| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 1.0     | OpenCDMS public release (2025, end of prototype phase) <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Support for standards supported by CDM, possibly not entire #1131 v2? (TBD) <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Migration paths to CDM (RI)|
